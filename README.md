# Full Stack Developer Assignment

This project is a full-stack application with a **Node.js backend** and a **React (Vite) frontend**. The application is structured into two main folders:

* `/backend` – Node.js (Express)
* `/frontend` – React with Vite

## 🔧 Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naraina20/narayan-assignment
cd narayan-assignment
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

You’ll find two environment files shared with the submission (via mail):

* `backend.env`
* `frontend.env`

Please rename and move them as follows:

* Move `backend.env` into the `/backend` folder and rename it to `.env`
* Move `frontend.env` into the `/frontend` folder and rename it to `.env`

```
/backend/.env
/frontend/.env
```

> ⚠️ These `.env` files contain **dummy/test values only**. There are no real or sensitive credentials, so there is no risk of data exposure.

### 3. Install dependencies and run the app

#### Backend (Node.js)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend (Vite React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 💡 Notes

* Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.
* The frontend communicates with the backend via environment variables.
* The project should run smoothly once `.env` files are placed correctly.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
/backend      ← Node.js + Express server
/frontend     ← React frontend (Vite)
```
